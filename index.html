			<h1>Hello, and welcome to the personal website of Nathan LaPierre!</h1>
		</div>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			I am a college student currently majoring in Applied Computer
			Science with a concentration in Software Engineering at George
			Mason University. I intend to pursue an Accelerated Master's
			Degree in Software Engineering from George Mason, which I hope
			to complete in 4.5 years. I am also a member of the George
			Mason University Honors College and the Student Run Computing
			and Technology (SRCT) club. I am an active developer both inside
			and outside of school. In addition to maintaining a 3.9-plus
			GPA and working on SRCT-related projects, I have also started
			several personal ventures, such as 
			<a href="http://www.nanbendo.com">Nanbendo</a>,
			a gaming and applications group, and 
			<a href="http://www.tabulater.com">TabULater</a>,
			a Chrome extension that helps monitor tabs. More details about
			me can be found in my resume, which I will attach soon. I
			will also post some essays of mine that I have written for
			scholarship applications. For more information, please contact
			me at nathanl2012@gmail.com (preferred) or 571-839-5008 with
			any questions.
